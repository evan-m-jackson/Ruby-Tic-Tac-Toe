# Ruby-Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! To start, simply download this file and save it anywhere on your computer. Using the terminal, navigate to the saved file's directory and type in the following commands to install all of the required Gems:

    bundle install

After that then the game is ready to play. Type in the following command to begin playing:

    ruby lib/tic_tac_toe.rb

This game is single player and the player will go against a CPU. The player always goes first and will be 'X'. The CPU will be 'O' and has never been beaten. Good luck!!

In order to run all the tests for the application, type in the following command in the terminal:

    rspec

To runs tests for a specific class, enter the following:
